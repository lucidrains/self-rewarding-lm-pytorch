## Self-Rewarding Language Model (wip)

Implementation of the training framework proposed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10020">Self-Rewarding Language Model</a>, from MetaAI

They really took the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290">title of the DPO paper</a> to heart.

May generalize the framework so one can add <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01335v1">SPIN</a> as well.

## Appreciation
